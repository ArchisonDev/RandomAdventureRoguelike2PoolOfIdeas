**How to: Add**

To add a new issue, please go first to the [ISSUES](https://github.com/LluisFelip/RandomAdventureRoguelike2PoolOfIdeas/issues) tab, and check if your idea (or a similar one) hasn't been already submitted by someone else. If it still doesn't exist, add a new one by clicking on the [NEW ISSUE](https://github.com/LluisFelip/RandomAdventureRoguelike2PoolOfIdeas/issues/new) button.


**Important Rules**

- To help everyone understand better your ideas, try to write them correclty (grammar, ortography, etc…). If an issue is poorly written or impossible to understand, it may be deleted, no hard feelings ;)

- Be polite. There can be discussions on each idea via comments. Feel free to discuss, edit and improve the ideas, but, please, be respectful and nice to the others :D 

- I'm doing this to make it easier to canalisez the players' ideas, suggestions and issues.

- I can't garantee any of these will be implemented in the game, but I'll do my best, and try to listen to all your suggestions and try to prioritise those which are most voted, but if I feel I don't like something or that it doesn't fit in what the game is, I hope you understand if it ends not being added into the game. Thanks a lot for your comprehension! :) 


**Thanks**
Thank you everyone who has been supporting the game in any way (reviews in Play Store, Reddit posts or comments, Discord channel, emails, etc…)! You can't imagine how it feels to receive such great feedback and see how people are immersed in this small text-adventure-ish world of mine. I promise I'll try to keep improving this for a long time!


**Coffee?**
I created this Ko-fi page because sometimes people asked me in the past on how to be able to donate me, I wasn't sure if adding this here, but here it is, in case you want to contribute to my caffeine addiction: [DONATE](https://ko-fi.com/archison) - THANKS A LOT!
